# Roadrunner Bundle

[RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/) is a high-performance PHP application server, load-balancer, and process manager written in Golang.

This bundle provides a RoadRunner Worker integrated in Symfony, it's easily configurable and extendable.

## Installation

Run the following command:

```
composer require baldinof/roadrunner-bundle
```

If you don't use Symfony Flex:
- register `Baldinof\RoadRunnerBundle\BaldinofRoadRunnerBundle` in your kernel
- copy default RoadRunner configuration files: `cp vendor/baldinof/roadrunner-bundle/.rr.* .`

## Usage

- get the RoadRunner binary: `vendor/bin/rr get --location bin/`
- run RoadRunner with `bin/rr serve`
- visit your app at http://localhost:8080

## Configuration

If you want to override some parts of the bundle you can replace some definitions.

Example if you want to use a TCP socket as relay:

```yaml
# config/services.yaml
services:
  Spiral\Goridge\RelayInterface:
    class: 'Spiral\Goridge\SocketRelay'
    arguments:
      - localhost
      - 7000
```

```yaml
# .rr.yaml
http:
  workers:
    relay: "tcp://localhost:7000"
```

## Integrations

Depending on installed bundle & your configuration, this bundles add some integrations:

- Sentry: configure the request context (if the [`SentryBundle`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-symfony) is installed)
- Sessions: add the session cookie to the PSR response (if `framework.sessions.enabled` config is `true`)
- Doctrine Mongo Bundle: call `clear()` on all opened manager after each requests (not needed for regular doctrine bundle)

Default integrations can be disabled:

```yaml
baldinof_road_runner:
  default_integrations: false
```

## Doctrine connection handler
Due to the fact that roadrunner assumes that the process works in demonized mode, there may be problems with disconnecting the database, this problem is handled in this bundle if a doctrine is used to connect to the database.

By default, in the event of a connection failure, the process will be stopped and the request will end with a 500 http code, to prevent this and to correctly process failed connections, without erroneous answers - you need to add [symfony/proxy-manager-bridge](https://github.com/symfony/proxy-manager-bridge) to your project:
```
composer require symfony/proxy-manager-bridge
```

## Sessions in database
In accordance with the problem described above, to store sessions in the database, you should use the doctrine connection, for example, you can use the [shapecode/doctrine-session-handler-bundle](https://github.com/shapecode/doctrine-session-handler-bundle) bundle

```
composer require shapecode/doctrine-session-handler-bundle
```

## Middlewares

You can use middlewares to manipulate PSR request & responses. Middlewares can implements either PSR [`MiddlewareInterface`](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/#22-psrhttpservermiddlewareinterface)
or [`Baldinof\RoadRunnerBundle\Http\IteratorMiddlewareInterface`](./src/Http/IteratorMiddlewareInterface.php).

`IteratorMiddlewareInterface` allows to do work after the response has been sent to the client, you just have to `yield` the response instead of returning it.

Example configuration:

```yaml
baldinof_road_runner:
    middlewares:
        - App\Middleware\YourMiddleware
```

Be aware that
- middlewares are run outside of Symfony `Kernel::handle()`
- the middleware stack is always resolved at worker start (can be a performance issue if your middleware initialization takes time)

## Metrics
Roadrunner have ability to [collect application metrics](https://roadrunner.dev/docs/beep-beep-metrics), enable metrics with this bundle configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/baldinof_road_runner.yaml
baldinof_road_runner:
    metrics_enabled: true
```

And configure RoadRunner:

```yaml
# .rr.yaml
rpc:
  enable: true
  listen: unix://var/roadrunner_rpc.sock

metrics:
  address: localhost:2112
  collect:
    app_metric_counter:
      type: counter
      help: "Application counter."
```

Simply inject `Spiral\RoadRunner\MetricsInterface` to record metrics:

```php
class YouController
{
    public function index(MetricsInterface $metrics): Response
    {
        $metrics->add('app_metric_counter', 1);

        return new Response("...");
    }
}
```

> If you inject `Spiral\RoadRunner\MetricsInterface`, but metrics collection is disabled in config, a [`NullMetrics`](./src/Metric/NullMetrics.php) will be injected and nothing will be collected.

## Kernel reboots

The Symfony kernel and the dependency injection container are **preserved between requests**. If an exception is thrown during the request handling, the kernel is rebooted and a fresh container is used.

The goal is to prevent services to be in a non recoverable state after an error.

To optimize your worker you can allow exceptions that does not put your app in an errored state:

```yaml
# config/packages/baldinof_road_runner.yaml
baldinof_road_runner:
    kernel_reboot:
      strategy: on_exception
      allowed_exceptions:
        - Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\HttpExceptionInterface
        - Symfony\Component\Serializer\Exception\ExceptionInterface
        - App\Exception\YourDomainException
```

If you are seeing issues and want to use a fresh container on each request you can use the `always` reboot strategy:

```yaml
# config/packages/baldinof_road_runner.yaml
baldinof_road_runner:
    kernel_reboot:
      strategy: always
```

> If some of your services are stateful, you can implement `Symfony\Contracts\Service\ResetInterface` and your service will be resetted on each request.

## Development mode

Copy the dev config file if it's not present: `cp vendor/baldinof/roadrunner-bundle/.rr.dev.yaml .`

Start RoadRunner with the dev config file:

```
bin/rr serve -c .rr.dev.yaml
```

Reference: https://roadrunner.dev/docs/beep-beep-reload

If you use the Symfony VarDumper, dumps will not be shown in the HTTP Response body. You can view dumps with `bin/console server:dump` or in the profiler.

## GRPC
This bundle have GRPC support (https://spiral.dev/docs/grpc-configuration), for enable it in roadrunner, please follow by documentation link.

```
workers:
    command: "php bin/console baldinof:roadrunner:grpc-worker"
    relay: "unix://var/roadrunner_grpc.sock"
```

For register service as GRPC availible, implement `Baldinof\RoadRunnerBundle\Grpc\GrpcServiceInterface` interface and tag it as `baldinof.roadrunner.grpc_service`.

By simple add this to `services.yaml`:
```
_instanceof:
    Baldinof\RoadRunnerBundle\Grpc\GrpcServiceInterface:
        tags: ['baldinof.roadrunner.grpc_service']
```
